# hello-gradle
Hello-Gradle

Just an Hello World program with [`GRADLE`](http://gradle.org/) as a build system.

## TIPS

When you add a new library to the project, in this example Joda Time, you can do the following from the console:

```sh
# build to download libraries into your local repository
gradle build
# update eclipse project to reflect new changes about the Java build path
gradle eclipse
``` 
and then Refresh you Eclipse Project.
